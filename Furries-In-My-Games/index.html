        <div id="title"><h1>Why are there furries in my video games?</h1></div>

        <div id="intro"><p>First off, lets talk about what kind of games you may think furries might inhabit more rather than others. You'd think they would only play games that reek of transgenderism, homosexualness, pornography, satanism or simply games which feature anthro characters. Games such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/" target="_blank">Cult of the Lamb</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/" target="_blank">Undertale</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/" target="_blank">Omori</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620520/Mondealy/" target="_blank">Mondealy</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/747660/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_Security_Breach/" target="_blank">Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/furry_shades_of_gay" target="_blank">Furry Shades of Gay</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1992370/FURRY_HITLER/" target="_blank">Furry Hitler</a>. Why do you assume that furries are going to play these games? Because they are furry in nature, furries are almost always depicted as this "progressive" group as in they possess all modern day disabilities.</p></div>

        <div id="think"><p>Now I want you to think about a game, in which you believe there are a lot of furries partaking in the community. Most people would say games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/" target="_blank">Hearts of Iron 4</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod" target="_blank">Garry's Mod</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/" target="_blank">Fallout 76</a>. Why is that? Why do furries play these games that seemingly have nothing in common with furry culture?</p></div>

        <div id="answer"><p>I used to be just like you, a total and complete faggot, a kike slave and I kept on asking myself these questions. And after seeking for an explanation for so long, I came up with an answer. You know how people often say that furries are creative? Well, I guess they are creative to a certain extent in the sense that its kinda normal that you would make your own things your own way since nobody else is willing to draw your fursona in some crazy fetishized furry porn or make you a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/" target="_blank">VRChat</a> avatar that can vore people. Furries love to express themselves whether that would be through having a furry Profile Picture, having a spray in-game that depicts furry artwork or buying and wearing "furry" cosmetics in-game, cause it makes it easier to find other furries and or because they feel as if thats their true nature so they feel more "free" by expressing themselves. And that is exactly why people think there are lots of furries in [INSERT RANDOM GAME HERE], let us not ignore the fact that being a furry is simply an umbrella term, you can be a furry and also have national socialistic views. You don't have to fit a stereotype to be a furry. The fact that furries are more expressionistic also makes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">them</span> <span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">(A Minority group in most games)</span> bigger than they really are. Sure there may be some games such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/" target="_blank">VRChat</a> where there are actually a lot of furries. <span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">(VRChat is divided into 2 groups, Furries and Weebs)</span> And why do you think that is? because <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/" target="_blank">VRChat</a> gives you even more freedom, you pick your avatar and you can make it literally whatever you want. It gives the full creative freedom that furries seek and long for. People love expressing their freedom in interestingly various different ways.</p></div>
