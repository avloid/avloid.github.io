        <h2>What would really help you in the start, when you want to generate furry images with AI?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>First off, having the specs to run Stable Diffusion. The most important part is the graphics card. I would recommend a MODERN card, with either 6 or 8 VRAM for the "low end", 8 VRAM is enough, you dont need more unless youre very picky and want instant 1 second wait times for images.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another important thing is: Knowing <a href="https://e621.net">e621</a> tags, but im sure no furry would struggle with that since all of them are porn addicts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you are using AI, you can't just be vague with your prompt and expect something good to pop out, you need to know exactly what you want and need. become a perfectionist, there is seemingly no limit to what you can generate, except for your imagination.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After having met all the requirements, you are ready to start generating your fantasy furry porn to satisfy your homosexual needs!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How to install</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I will assume that you are on Windows and you are using an Nvidia card, so follow this tutorial only if you use those</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/">Install Python 3.10.6</a></p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Install Git</a></p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui#automatic-installation-on-windows">Install Stable diffusion</a> by right clicking on a folder in which you want to install it, then pressing "Open Git Bash here", after which a terminal will open, write in the terminal "git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git"</p>
        <br>
        <p>After that, you are technically done, but there are some optimizations and settings that you will most likely need for furry AI generation</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Setup and Optimizations</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Go to your stable diffusion folder, scroll down until you find "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">webui-user.bat</span>" once you open it, go to the 6th line Where it asks for Commandline Arguements, there you should write "--autolaunch --xformers". xformers makes images generate faster. Then go to the 3rd line where it asks for the path of Python, find where python is installed on your pc and paste the location here, it should look like this  "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">C:\Users\****\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe</span>"</p>
        <br>
        <p>It should look something like this:</p>
        <img src="images/example.png" alt="" width="50%">
        <br>
        <p>You will need <em style="text-decoration:underline; color: red; cursor: pointer;" title="Models are files that are trained on ALOT of different images">models</em>, such as:</p>
        <span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">(Most of the time have 2 files that need to be put in your Models/Stable-diffusion folder)</span>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I highly recommend, when first starting out, you take a look at a model's civitai comments or posts, especially if you are struggling to make any images. <span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">(Most posts also share the prompts that are used)</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>You will need <em style="text-decoration:underline; color: red; cursor: pointer;" title="Loras are files that are trained on SPECIFIC images, such as a furry specific species or character">loras</em></p>
        <span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">(1 file that needs to be put in your Models/Lora folder)</span>

        <p>You will need <em style="text-decoration:underline; color: red; cursor: pointer;" title="I dont know :)">Embeddings</em></p>
        <span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">(1 file that needs to be put in your /Embeddings folder)</span>
